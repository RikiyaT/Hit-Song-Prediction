# Hit-Song-Prediction
This is a research of making a system that predicts future hit-songs. 

It is a field of Hit Song Science, which is a type of Music Information Retrieval.

In this research, I got music audio data, lyrics data and twitter data from multiple APIs. 
Utilizing multiple sentiment analysis tools, I got data of sentiment features related to the songs.

I used multiple classifications and regressions to get the predictions.
