Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off of love, drunk from my hate It's like I'm huffing paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She fuckin' hates me, and I love it  ""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you"" ""No, you ain't, come back"" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"" I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength  Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409623213357)"
